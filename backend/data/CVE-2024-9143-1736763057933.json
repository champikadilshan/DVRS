Impact summary: Out of bound memory writes can lead to an application crash or even a possibility of a 11/21/2024\nremote code execution, however, in all the protocols involving Elliptic Curve Cryptography that we're aware of, either only \"named curves‚Äù are ~~ Source:\nsupported, or, if explicit curve parameters are supported, they specify an X9.62 encoding of binary (GF(2Am)) curves that can't represent OpenSSL Software Foundation\nproblematic input values. Thus the likelihood of existence of a vulnerable application is low. In particular, the X9.62 encoding is used for ECC\nkeys in X.509 certificates, so problematic inputs cannot occur in the context of processing X.509 certificates. Any problematic use-cases would\nhave to be using an \"exotic\" curve encoding. The affected APIs include: EC_GROUP_new_curve_GF2m(), EC_GROUP_new_from_params(),\nand various supporting BN_GF2m_*() functions. Applications working with \"exotic\" explicit binary (GF(2\"m)) curve parameters, that make it\npossible to represent invalid field polynomials with a zero constant term, via the above or similar APIs, may terminate abruptly as a result of\nreading or writing outside of array bounds. Remote code execution cannot easily be ruled out. The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not\naffected by this issue.\nMetrics JEEEERIXB Cvssversion3x | CVSS Version 2.0\nNVD enrichment efforts reference publicly available information to associate vector strings.
